This is a similar project to my BukkitDataHandler(https://github.com/IgnisOwl/BukkitDataHandler), but will refrain from reading or writing to the file until **DataHandler.update()** is called.

**DataHandler.initializeScheduledUpdate(*ticks*) will allow you to automatically update the file every certain amount of ticks* 


PLEASE NOTE: The BungeeCord branch has not been updated yet
